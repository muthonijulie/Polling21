## Polling Application with Real-Time Updates
This project is a polling system with real-time updates built using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io. It allows users to create polls, vote in real-time, and see results instantly. This README covers the installation process, features, and technical details of both the frontend and backend.

## Features
- Real-time Updates: The system allows real-time voting updates and poll result changes using Socket.io.
- Polling System: Users can create polls with multiple choice options and vote on them.
- Real-time Vote Tracking: When a user votes, the vote count and results are updated for all connected users in real-time.
- MongoDB Integration: All polls and votes are stored in MongoDB for persistent data.
- User-Friendly Interface: The frontend is built using React for a dynamic, interactive experience.
## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Socket.io-client
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- Database: MongoDB
- Real-time Communication: Socket.io
## Prerequisites
  Ensure you have the following installed:

  Node.js (with npm)
  MongoDB (or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database)
  npm (Node package manager)
## Installation
  Follow the steps below to get your polling system up and running locally.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polling-system.git
cd polling-system
```
## Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory.
```bash
cd backend
```
Install the backend dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
Create a .env file in the backend directory to set up environment variables like MongoDB URI.
Example .env:

```env

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/polling-app
PORT=4000
```
Run the backend server.
```bash
npm start
```
Your backend server should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

## Step 3: Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory.
```bash
cd ../frontend
```
Install the frontend dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
Start the frontend development server.
```bash
npm start
```
The React app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Step 4: Access the Polling System
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the polling system.

## Backend Details
The backend is built using Node.js and Express and connects to a MongoDB database to store poll data. Socket.io is used for real-time communication, so the backend can push updates to the frontend whenever a vote is cast or a poll is updated.

## Key Endpoints
POST /api/polls: Create a new poll.

Request body:
json
Copy
{
  "question": "Your poll question",
  "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
}
GET /api/polls: Get all polls.

GET /api/polls/:id: Get details of a single poll by ID.

POST /api/votes: Cast a vote for a poll.

Request body:
json
Copy
{
  "pollId": "poll_id_here",
  "option": "selected_option"
}
## Real-time Updates with Socket.io
The backend uses Socket.io to emit events whenever there is a new vote or poll update:

Event vote_cast: Emitted when a vote is cast to notify clients of the updated vote count.
Event new_poll: Emitted when a new poll is created.
## MongoDB Schema
The MongoDB schema consists of two main collections:

Polls: Stores information about each poll, including the question, options, and vote count.
Votes: Stores individual votes with user details (optional).
Example of Poll schema:

```javascript
const pollSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  question: { type: String, required: true },
  options: [
    { option: String, votes: { type: Number, default: 0 } }
  ]
});
```
## Frontend Details
The frontend is built with React. It communicates with the backend via HTTP requests for creating and retrieving polls and uses Socket.io-client to listen for real-time updates.

## Key Components
PollList: Displays all available polls and allows users to vote.
PollDetail: Displays detailed poll information and allows users to vote for specific options.
SocketHandler: Manages Socket.io connections and listens for real-time updates.
## Real-time Updates with Socket.io
The frontend uses Socket.io-client to listen for events from the backend:

vote_cast: Updates the vote count in real-time when a vote is cast.
new_poll: Displays a new poll in the list when it is created.
Running the Frontend
After installation and setup, you can use the following commands to run the frontend app:

```bash
npm start
```
The app will open on http://localhost:3000, where you can view and interact with the polls.

## Troubleshooting
CORS issues: If you encounter CORS errors, ensure that your backend server is correctly configured to allow requests from the frontend.

Socket.io Connection: Ensure that both the frontend and backend are running and the correct port numbers are configured.
